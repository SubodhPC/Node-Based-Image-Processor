# Node-Based-Image-Processor
Node Based image processing software using ImGui + OpenGL. 

This a project for learning.
It is based on an assignment I received to develop a "Node-Based Image Manipulation Interface".

It is meant to support 10 types of nodes.

Basic Nodes 
1. Image Input Node 
2. Output Node 
3. Brightness/Contrast Node 
4. Color Channel Splitter 

Intermediate Nodes 
5. Blur Node 
6. (TBD)Threshold Node 
7. (TBD)Edge Detection Node 
8. (TBD)Blend Node 

Advanced Nodes 
9. (TBD)Noise Generation Node 
10. (TBD)Convolution Filter Node 

Status:
Currently working on the speed of the blur operation.
